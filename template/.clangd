# clangd configuration: provide fallback include paths so the language server
# can resolve headers located in the repository when compile_commands.json
# isn't available or hasn't been picked up yet.
CompileFlags:
  Add: ["-Isrc"]

# Note: If you generate a compile_commands.json in dist (Meson does this),
# it's best to either symlink it to the repository root:
#   ln -s dist/compile_commands.json compile_commands.json
# or configure your editor/clangd to use the dist compile database so
# that per-file compile flags are derived from the build system instead.
